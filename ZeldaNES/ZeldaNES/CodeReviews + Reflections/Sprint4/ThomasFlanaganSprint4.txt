READABILITY
-Variable names are simple and descriptive, but some like teleportedDirection could be clearer
-The structure of the code generally follows the format of other physics subhandlers
-Debug lines leftover from testing need to be removed.

CODE QUALITY
-Single purpose methods that do exactly and only exactly as they should
-Magic numbers currently being used, but mentioned as a point to correct soon
-Current bug where there's still a few teleportations each time when entering a North Door
-Aside from changing from magic numbers to constants, the coordinate change for link when entering North doors also needs to be asjusted to prevent the aforementioned glitch
-Great base on which to build the rest of the screen transitions and other Door related Physics.


Reflection:
I think because of conflicting schedules and busy classes, we weren't able to make as much time as last sprint to meet as an entire group and discuss ideas.
This led to most of our group discussions being done in the classroom, with most of the coding being done on our own. I think this slowed down certain parts
of our build. However, we did a much better job this sprint assigning specific roles to each member of the team, which I believed reduced the amount of work
certain members were expected to complete while giving others a chance to implement their own ideas.
