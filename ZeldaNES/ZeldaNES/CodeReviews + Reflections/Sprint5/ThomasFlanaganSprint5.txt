READABILITY
The wallmaster npc class itself operates similarly to other npc's so it maintains the same expected level of readability.
The additional method included in the physics handler to move link is also clearly structured and uses variable names well.
There is a little bit of magic numbering in the wallmaster file, with the enemy health value just set to 3 over referencing a separate file.
CODE QUALITY
The code itself works well for what it is meant to do. All of the Wallmaster code is functional and follows the structure of the other
enemies, letting it be easily understood and maintained. The physics end of the code is alsoo quite good. It doesn't leave any issues related
to coordinate swaps.
