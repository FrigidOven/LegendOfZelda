READABILITY
-Great descriptive comments before large blocks of code
-Proper variable names given the usage of Tree
-Comments before method definitions could be helpful

-Good use of constants instead of magic numbers
-Could be hard to go in an find exact points of failure
if this code were to fail, however that is to be expected 
for code this complex
-Overall, this class was made with care to be maintanable and adaptable
