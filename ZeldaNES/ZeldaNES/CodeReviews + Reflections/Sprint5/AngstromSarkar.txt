Code reviewed: Cheatcode.cs
Code author: Joey Zhou
Time: 10 minutes

READABILITY:
	- Overall understandable.
	- However, the fact that the implementation of the cheat codes involves multiple classes (one of which is in a different folder) may confuse
	readers who are unaware of the fact.

QUALITY:
	- Still not fully sure why the implementation is split between Cheatcode.cs and CheatCommand.cs, though this may be simply because of some
	programming technique that I am unaware of.
	- In theory, each cheatcode may be implementable as its own unique class, inhereiting from a superclass, which may make the code more "modular".
	- Though these changes COULD be made, the code is functional as is, and could still easily be modified.
