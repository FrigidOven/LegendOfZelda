code reviewed: Hitbox.cs

readability: though i do not know exactly what some of the stuff does, i feel like if i actually took the time to sit down and look over
everything, i probably could understand it

code quality: seems relatively easy to maintain, as most constants are not magic numbers and most functions are relatively short and simple. this
also probably helps in terms of readability
