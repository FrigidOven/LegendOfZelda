READABILITY
- The code is super clean.
- easy to follow
- I also like that we have each type of interaction done seperately 

MAINTAINABILITY
- I think it should be a static class that gets called from the main physics handler, which would also be a static class
  The reasoning being that I am assuming we wont want multiple instances of physics in the game.
- great job!
