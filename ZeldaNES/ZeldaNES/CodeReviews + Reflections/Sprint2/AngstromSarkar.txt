Code reviewed: StalfoSprite.cs

NOTES: When I made the floor tile spriteclass, this was one of the files that I found helpful. It gave me a general idea as to how
creating sprites for things worked.
READABILITY: Overall the code is somewhat easy to understand, so long as you know what all the functions it calls do.
MAINTAINABILITY: Because a lot of the things in the code are built on other functions and objects, changing the class would be, theoretically,
very easy. For example, if someone changed any of the things used (such as the enemy sprite constants), they would most likely have to change
very little, as that is defined as a variable within its own file, and then imported into the class.
