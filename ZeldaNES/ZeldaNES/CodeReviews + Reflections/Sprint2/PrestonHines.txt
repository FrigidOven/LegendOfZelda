COMMENTS:
I think the switch case is really nice and the overall flow of the class is really concise. The different states help the readability. Something maybe I'd like to see
is a comment in the header specifying how the different ints map to the different Goriya states. The last think is the movement speed is a little magic numbery. 
I think we should make an NPCEnemyConstants file to store this data all in one place

COMMENTS:
Overall good readabilty, which makes sense since it is an interface. Some things I would do is refrain from using
"Why" instead of "Y", and perhaps a reduction in comments, but overall good method choice in my opinion. I like the
regularity the interface brings in the overall structure of our solution. 
CHANGES:
I think I would uncomment out the setters in the interface. I think having the same interface for movable and imovable
objects is nice. Something also we might consider is having some way to query the interface as to the static/dynamic
of the tile in question.
