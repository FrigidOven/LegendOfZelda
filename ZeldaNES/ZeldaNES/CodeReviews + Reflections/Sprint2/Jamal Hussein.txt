Readability:

This code contains a rewrite of the generic sprite code and will be the new standard moving forwards.
As it stands, the code is consice, with very little unecessary complexity. As a result the code reads
almost like english. The only qualms I have are the choice of variable names. They should be consistent
across the entirety of the program yet spritebatch is named sb here where it is otherwise just spritebatch,
likewise with texture which is now tex, and the generic "owner" title works well for weapons as weapons are
logically owned by something or someone but items sprites arent really owned by anything. I think the name
item would fit better here instead. As well, the sprite locations are stored in static integers which is an odd
choice, they now belong to the sprite class itself when they already belonged to sprite constants file. I would
forego this route as it adds unecessary rigidity to the class, calling the constants file may be more characters
but in so doing the code is more understandble as the variables are more descriptive.

Code quality:

-Incredibly reusable, works with animated and non-animated sprites.
-Much less complexity than the existing sprite code, cuts down on conditional logic and ternary assignments.
-Some unecessary redeclarations (why is there a new rectangle being created every single time it is drawn?).
-Very loose coupling, only refrences an objects position inside of it and is only tasked with drawing it at that position.
