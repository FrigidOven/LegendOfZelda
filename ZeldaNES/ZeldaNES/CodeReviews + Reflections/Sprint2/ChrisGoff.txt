READABILITY
-Local variable names are well defined and intuitive, could be grouped and separated by whitespace to
make it a little more readable
-Consistent comments before large chunks of code enable readability
-Certain elements of the Update() method could be modularized into additional methods to enable readability
-Usage of the "?" operator is not very readable
Time taken to complete review: 15 minutes

CODE QUALITY
-Usage of constant values will maintain usability of the class if the sprite sheet changes
-Proper implementation of ISprite methods
-Contructor parameters are different than that of other enemies, could lead to issues
-Five contructor paramters, could potentially be reduced
Hypotetical Change that Could Cause Problems: The current implementation takes sprite sheets as a 
constructor paramter. If there were additional animation frames added for the Boss that, for example, change
its color, and these sprites were contained in a different sprite sheet, then there would have to be
moderate refactoring done to accomodate this.
